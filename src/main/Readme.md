
**Project Overview:**

This project analyzes three different methods of extracting and deserializing JSON data using Jackson. The first pair of programming classes serves as a playground for experimenting with various approaches, while the subsequent classes demonstrate each method in detail. Below are the three approaches explored in this project:

**1) Deserializing into a Map:**

This method involves deserializing the JSON directly into a `Map<String, Object>`. It allows for dynamic handling of the data without the need for predefined classes. This approach is flexible but less type-safe, making it useful when the JSON structure may vary or when you prefer a more generic solution.

**2) Deserializing with JsonNode (Unified API):**

This approach uses Jackson's `JsonNode` class to deserialize the JSON into a tree-like structure. The `JsonNode` API allows for flexible navigation of the JSON, giving you access to the data while abstracting away the underlying structure. This method is simpler when you need to work with specific parts of the JSON without mapping the entire structure to custom classes.

**3) Deserializing into Custom Classes (1:1 Mapping) - Best Approach:**

In this method, we define custom classes that exactly match the structure of the JSON data. Jackson then deserializes the JSON directly into these classes, providing a type-safe and structured approach. This method is ideal when you have a well-defined JSON structure and want to work with the data in a strongly-typed manner.
